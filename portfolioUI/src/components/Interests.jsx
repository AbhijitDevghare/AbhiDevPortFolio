              I am a huge fan of music, especially the soulful voice of Arijit Singh.
              His songs inspire me deeply and help me stay motivated during coding
              sessions. Music for me is not just entertainment, it‚Äôs a source of comfort,
              creativity, and emotional expression.

              Football is more than a game for me ‚Äî it taught me teamwork, discipline,

              I became a huge fan of Virat Kohli when I watched his amazing performance

              me a lot. Kohli's leadership on the field and his consistency made me admire
              cricket more deeply and taught me the importance of focus and hard work.

          While I embrace many interests, I dislike negativity and close-mindedness.

          learning new things or meeting people from diverse backgrounds.

          Also, I‚Äôm not a fan of loud, distracting environments when I need to focus.
          Peace and quiet help me think deeply and code efficiently.
